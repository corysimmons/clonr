# clonr

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/corysimmons/clonr.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Clone repos from Github quickly and easily without having to copy/paste the SSH git URI each time.

### Installation
- `npm install -g clonr`

### Usage
- `clonr username/repo` or `clonr username/repo foo`
- e.g. `clonr jquery/jquery`


### Wishlist
- Use Github API to make search even more flexible. For instance, you'd be able to `clonr jquery` and it would find the most starred "jquery" repo and clone it.
